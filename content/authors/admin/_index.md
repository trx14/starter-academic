Howdy! I am currently a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Texas A&M University. My advisor is [Dr. Xia Hu](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html), who leads the DATA Lab. I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Jiwen Lu. 

My research interests lies on interpretable machine learning, with a particular interest in the areas of DNN interpretability. I'm also interested in areas of fairness in deep learning, backdoor & trojan attack, and AI-assisted medical diagnosis.
